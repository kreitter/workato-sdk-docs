# [#](<#how-to-guides-json-web-token-authentication>) How-to guides - JSON web token authentication

JSON Web Token(JWT) is an Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims.

In authentication, JWTS are signed either using a private or public key. For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim "logged in as admin" and provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that it is logged in as admin. The authorized client can then pull information that admins are cleared to access.

JWTs are designed to be compact, URL-safe, and usable especially in a web-browser single-sign-on (SSO) context.

## [#](<#step-1-defining-connection-fields>) Step 1 - Defining Connection fields

This component tells Workato what fields to show to a user trying to establish a connection. In the case of Client Credentials Authentication, you would need the Client ID and Client Secret that the user has generated in Percolate.

Information needed | Description  
---|---  
Issuer | The "iss" (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT.  
Subject | The "sub" (subject) claim identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. The claims in a JWT are normally statements about the subject. In this case, it is the email address of the user that you are impersonating.  
Private/public key | This is the "password" that is obtained from the downloaded JSON.  

This is done in the `fields` key, which accepts an array of hashes. Each hash in this array corresponds to a separate input field.
```ruby
        fields: [
          {
            name: 'iss',
            label: 'Issuer',
            optional: false,
            hint: 'The email address of the service account'
          },
          {
            name: 'sub',
            label: 'Email address',
            optional: false,
            hint: 'Email address of the user that you are impersonating'
          },
          {
            name: 'private_key',
            optional: false,
            hint: 'Copy and paste the private key that came from the downloaded json.<br>' \
              "Click <a href='https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account/' " \
              "target='_blank'>here</a> to learn more about Google Service Accounts.",
            control_type: 'password',
            multiline: true
          }
        ],
```

TIP

When defining fields, you need to at least provide the `name` key. Additional attributes like `optional`, `hint` and `control_type` allow you to customize other aspects of these fields. For sensitive information like Client Secrets, remember to use the `control_type` as `password`.

## [#](<#step-2-defining-the-authorization-type>) Step 2 - Defining the authorization type

This component tells Workato what to do with the values received from the input fields to establish a connection. This is handled through your `authorization` key. In this key, you begin by first defining the `type` of authorization. For JWT authentication, you should use `custom_auth`.
```ruby
        type: 'custom_auth'
```

## [#](<#step-3-acquiring-the-access-token>) Step 3 - Acquiring the access token

In the `acquire` key, we first generate a JWT token by creating a JWT body claim and signing it with the private key that the user provided. We do this by passing in the `jwt_body_claim` and `private_key` to Workato, note that this must be sent with `jwt_encode` under the `RS256` signing algorithm. Next, we then pass in the generated token to Google API's token URL as payload. Here, we assign the `grant_type` and `assertion` as `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` and the generated JWT token respectively. Note that the payload of the request must be sent with `request_format_www_form_urlencoded`.
```ruby
        acquire: lambda do |connection|
          jwt_body_claim = {
            "iat": now.to_i,
            "exp": 1.hour.from_now.to_i,
            "aud": 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token',
            "iss": connection['iss'],
            "sub": connection['sub'],
            "scope": 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar'
          }
          private_key = connection['private_key'].gsub(/\\n/, "\n")
          jwt_token = workato.jwt_encode(jwt_body_claim, private_key, "RS256")

          post('https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token').
            payload(grant_type: 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer',
              assertion: jwt_token)
            .request_format_www_form_urlencoded
        end,
```

Upon receiving a the request, the API returns a JSON response.
```ruby
    {
      "access_token": "my-authentication-token",
      "token_type": "bearer",
      "expires_in": "seconds-until-expiration",
      "error": "optional-error-message"
    }
```

## [#](<#step-4-applying-the-access-token-to-subsequent-http-requests>) Step 4 - Applying the access token to subsequent HTTP requests

Next, you need to tell Workato how to make use of the access token it has retrieved from Google calendar. This is done in the `apply` block where you can reference the access token now stored in the `connection` argument. Any instructions you introduce in the `apply` block are subsequently applied to all HTTP requests this connector sends after connection is established.
```ruby
        apply: lambda do |connection|
          headers("Authorization": "Bearer #{connection['access_token']}")
        end
```

In this example, we have defined the access token (`connection['access_token']`) to be added to the headers of any request. For every HTTP request sent, the headers will contain `Authorization: Bearer XXX` where `XXX` is the access token stored in the `connection` hash.

## [#](<#step-5-defining-token-refresh-behavior>) Step 5 - Defining token refresh behavior

As JWT tokens are only valid for short amounts of time, we need to tell this connector to refresh the JWT token when it expires. This can be easily done with the `refresh_on` key, that contains a list of HTTP response codes or regex functions. This list is matched to any responses to a HTTP request and triggers the `acquire` key is a match is found.
```ruby
        refresh_on: [401, 403],
```

## [#](<#step-6-setting-the-api-s-base-uri>) Step 6 - Setting the API's base URI

This component tells Workato what the base URL of the API is. This key is optional but allows you to provide only relative paths in the rest of your connector when defining HTTP requests. Learn how to configure your `base_uri` [here](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/connection.html#base-uri>).
```ruby
        base_uri: lambda do
          'https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3'
        end
```

TIP

This lambda function also has access to the `connection` argument. This is especially useful if the base URI of the API might change based on the user's instance. The `connection` argument can be accessed in the following format:
```ruby
        base_uri: lambda do |connection|
          "https://#{connection['domain'].com/api}"
        end
```

## [#](<#step-7-testing-the-connection>) Step 7 - Testing the connection

Now that we have defined the fields we need to collect from an end user and what to do with the inputs from those fields, we now need a way to test this connection. This is handled in the `test` key.
```ruby
        test: lambda do |connection|
          get("/colors")
        end
```

In this key, you need to provide an endpoint that allows us to send a sample request using the new credentials we just received. If we receive a 200 OK HTTP response, we show the connection as Successful. In the example above, we are sending a `GET` request to the [`/colors` endpoint (opens new window)](<https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/colors/get>) and expecting a 200 response if the JWT is valid.
