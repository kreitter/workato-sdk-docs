# [#](<#how-to-guide-oauth-2-0-client-credentials-authentication>) How-to Guide - OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Authentication

The OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow is traditionally a way for server to server authentication. This allows you to build a connector that can authenticate as the Workato server which communicates to your target API server.

## [#](<#sample-connector-percolate>) Sample Connector - Percolate
```ruby
 
    {
      title: 'My Percolate connector',

      connection: {
        fields: [
          {
            name: 'client_id',
            optional: false,
          },
          {
            name: 'client_secret',
            control_type: 'password',
            optional: false,
          }
        ],

        authorization: {
          type: 'custom_auth', #Set to custom_auth

          acquire: lambda do |connection|
            hash = ("#{connection['client_id']}:#{connection['client_secret']}").base64.gsub("\n", '')
              # Token URL
            response = post('https://percolate.com/auth/v5/token/'). 
                          payload(grant_type: 'client_credentials').
                          headers(Authorization: "Basic " + hash).
                          request_format_www_form_urlencoded

            {
              access_token: response["access_token"],
              refresh_token: response["refresh_token"]
            }
          end,

          detect_on: [401, 403],

          refresh_on: [401, 403],

          apply: lambda do |connection|
            headers("Authorization": "Bearer #{connection['access_token']}")
          end
        },

        base_uri: lambda do |connection|
          'https://percolate.com'
        end

      },

      test: lambda do |connection|
        get('/api/v5/me')
      end,

## [#](<#step-1-defining-connection-fields>) Step 1 - Defining Connection fields

This component tells Workato what fields to show to a user trying to establish a connection. In the case of Client Credentials Authentication, you would need the Client ID and Client Secret that the user has generated in Percolate.

Information needed | Description  
---|---  
Client ID | This is the public ID of the OAuth app that should be tied to Workato. This might mean signing Workato up as a verified application in the application  
Client secret | This is the matching private key that the API will verify along with the Client ID. This might mean signing Workato up as a verified application in the application. **Never share your client secret with others**  

This is done in the `fields` key, which accepts an array of hashes. Each hash in this array corresponds to a separate input field.
```ruby
 
        fields: [
          {
            name: 'client_id',
            optional: false,
          },
          {
            name: 'client_secret',
            control_type: 'password',
            optional: false,
          }
        ],


```

TIP

When defining fields, you need to at least provide the `name` key. Additional attributes like `optional`, `hint` and `control_type` allow you to customize other aspects of these fields. For sensitive information like Client Secrets, remember to use the `control_type` as `password`.

## [#](<#step-2-defining-the-authorization-type>) Step 2 - Defining the authorization type

This component tells Workato what type of authentication type this connection should use. This is handled through your `type` key in the `authorization` object. For Client Credentials authentication, you should use `custom_auth`.
```ruby
 
          type: 'custom_auth'


```

## [#](<#step-3-acquiring-the-access-token>) Step 3 - Acquiring the access token

The next step is to define what this connector should do to retrieve an access token. This is done in the `acquire` lambda function.
```ruby
 
          acquire: lambda do |connection|
            hash = ("client:#{connection['client_id']}:#{connection['client_secret']}").base64.gsub("\n", '')
            response = post('https://percolate.com/auth/v5/token/'). # Token URL
                          payload(grant_type: 'client_credentials').
                          headers(Authorization: "Basic " + hash).
                          request_format_www_form_urlencoded

            {
              access_token: response["access_token"]
            }
          end,


```

In the `acquire` key, we pass in the `client_id` and `client_secret` which were input fields defined in the `fields` key. These values are available via the argument to the lambda function - `connection`. We pass them as headers and in BASE-64 String encoding. Note that the body of the request must be sent with `request_format_www_form_urlencoded` as per Percolates requirements. This request is then sent to Percolate's Token URL.

Upon receiving a the request, the API returns a JSON response.
```ruby
 
    {
      "access_token": "my-authentication-token",
      "token_type": "bearer",
      "expires_in": "seconds-until-expiration",
      "error": "optional-error-message"
    }


```

The output of the `acquire` lambda function is expected to be an object which is merged into the original connection object. For example:
```bash
 
    # Original Connection hash
    {
      client_id: "abcd1234",
      client_secret: "secretClientSecret"
    }

    # After acquire key is executed
    {
      client_id: "abcd1234",
      client_secret: "secretClientSecret",
      access_token: "my-authentication-token"
    }


```

## [#](<#step-4-applying-the-access-token-to-subsequent-http-requests>) Step 4 - Applying the access token to subsequent HTTP requests

Next, you need to tell Workato how to make use of the access token it has retrieved from Percolate. This is done in the `apply` key where you can reference the access token now stored in the `connection` argument. Any instructions you introduce in the `apply` key are subsequently applied to all HTTP requests this connector sends after connection is established.
```ruby
 
        apply: lambda do |connection|
          headers("Authorization": "Bearer #{connection['access_token']}")
        end


```

In this example, we have defined the access token (`connection['access_token']`) to be added to the headers of any request. For every HTTP request sent, the headers will contain `Authorization: Bearer XXX` where `XXX` is the access token stored in the `connection` hash.

## [#](<#step-5-defining-token-refresh-behavior>) Step 5 - Defining token refresh behavior

There may be situations in which the API expires the access token after a prescribed amount of time. In these cases, you would need to define `refresh_on` signals to let Workato know when to retrieve a new access_token from the OAuth server. `refresh_on` accepts an array which may contain HTTP response codes or regex strings.

If an HTTP request in the connector receives any of the HTTP response codes, it will attempt to retrieve a new access token. Likewise, if the contents of the body payload matches any of the defined regex strings, it will retrieve a new access token.

In the example using `type: custom_auth`, it will execute the code in the `acquire` key.
```ruby
 
        refresh_on: [401, 403],


```

When the `acquire` lambda is run again, this is the expected response from Percolate.
```ruby
 
    {
      "access_token": "my-NEW-authentication-token",
      "token_type": "bearer",
      "expires_in": "seconds-until-expiration",
      "error": "optional-error-message"
    }


```

The expected output of the `acquire` lambda function is a hash which is merged into the original connection hash. For example:
```bash
 
    # Original Connection hash
    {
      client_id: "abcd1234",
      client_secret: "secretClientSecret",
      access_token: "my-authentication-token"
    }

    # After acquire lambda is executed
    {
      client_id: "abcd1234",
      client_secret: "secretClientSecret",
      access_token: "my-NEW-authentication-token"
    }


```

## [#](<#step-6-setting-the-api-s-base-uri>) Step 6 - Setting the API's base URI

This component tells Workato what the base URL of the API is. This key is optional but allows you to provide only relative paths in the rest of your connector when defining HTTP requests. Learn how to configure your `base_uri` [here](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/connection.html#base-uri>).
```ruby
 
        base_uri: lambda do |connection|
          'https://percolate.com'
        end


```

TIP

This lambda function also has access to the `connection` argument. This is especially useful if the base URI of the API might change based on the user's instance. The `connection` argument can be accessed in the following format:
```ruby
 
        base_uri: lambda do |connection|
          "https://#{connection['domain'].com/api}"
        end


```

## [#](<#step-7-testing-the-connection>) Step 7 - Testing the connection

Now that we have defined the fields we need to collect from an end user and what to do with the inputs from those fields, we now need a way to test this connection. This is handled in the `test` key.
```ruby
 
        test: lambda do
          get('/api/v5/me')
        end,


```

In this block, you need to provide an endpoint that allows us to send a sample request using the new credentials we just received. If we receive a 200 OK HTTP response, we show the connection as Successful. In the example above, we are sending a `GET` request to the `/api/v5/me` endpoint and expecting a 200 response if the API key is valid.
