# [#](<#how-to-guides-updating-objects>) How-to guides - Updating objects

In this segment, we will be going through the creation of actions that help update objects in our target application. Typically, The `PUT` HTTP request method is used to send requests to update objects.

ACTION TIMEOUT

SDK actions have a 180 second [timeout](</recipes/recipe-job-errors.html#timeouts>) limit.

## [#](<#sample-connector-zuora>) Sample connector - Zuora
```ruby
 
    {
      title: 'My Zuora connector',

![Selecting the update account action](/assets/img/update_overall.2765b0cc.png) _Selecting the update account action_

## [#](<#step-1-action-title-subtitle-description-and-help>) Step 1 - Action title, subtitle, description, and help

The first step to making a good action is to properly communicate what the actions does, how it does it and to provide additional help to users. To do so, Workato allows you to define the title, description, and provide hints for an action. Quite simply, the title is the title of an action and the subtitle provides further details of the action. The description of the action then contains specifications and explanation on what the action accomplishes and in the context of the application it connects to. Finally, the help segment provides users any additional information required to make the action work.

To know more about this step, take a look at our [SDK reference](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/actions.html#title>)

## [#](<#step-2-define-input-fields>) Step 2 - Define input fields
```ruby
 
      input_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|
        [
          {
            name: "id",
            label: "Account ID",
            hint: "ID of the account you wish to update.",
            optional: false
          },
          {
            name: "BillingDate",
            label: "Billing date",
            hint: "The date at which to bill an account."
          },
          {
            name: "AccountName",
            label: "Account name",
            hint: "The name of newly created account."
          },
          {
            name: "Currency",
            label: "Currency",
            hint: "Currency that the customer is billed in."
          }
        ]
      end


```

![Update account input fields](/assets/img/update_input.985b9e8a.png) _Update account input fields_

This component tells Workato what fields to show to a user trying to update an object. In the case of updating an account in Zuora for example, the user has to input the `id`, `BillingDate`, `AccountName` and `Currency` of the existing account to be updated.

Do note the differences from the [create object](</developing-connectors/sdk/guides/building-actions/create-objects.html>) action, it is typical that the fields for different actions to differ, although the particular object involved remain the same. From the example provided, the `AccountNumber` of the account is not updatable, hence the field should not be available to users in this action. Also, the `Currency` field is now optional to fill in as there is already an existing currency attached to the account.

Various other key value pairs exist for input/output fields other than the ones defined above. Click [here](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/actions.html#input-fields>) to find out more.

Object definitions

Note that `object_definitions` is passed in as an argument. Workato allows connector builders to supply the definitions of an object separately in the "object_definitions" key. This key is used when the definitions of an object are large and/or can be dynamically obtained.

To know more about this, take a look at our [SDK reference](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/object_definitions.html>)

## [#](<#step-3-defining-the-execute-key>) Step 3 - Defining the execute key

The execute key tells Workato the endpoint to send the request to and using which HTTP request method. In this example, we send our request to `https://rest.zuora.com/v1/object/account` using the `PUT` method. We also append the `after_error_response` method to the request to catch any errors and to display them to users to aid in the debugging during recipe building.
```ruby
 
      execute: lambda do |connection, input|
        post("https://rest.zuora.com/v1/object/account", input).
          after_error_response(/.*/) do |_, body, _, message|
            error("#{message}: #{body}")
          end
      end


```

## [#](<#step-4-defining-output-fields>) Step 4 - Defining output fields

This section tells us what datapills to show as the output of the trigger. The `name` attributes of each datapill should match the keys in the output of the `execute` key.
```ruby
 
      output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|
        [
          { name: "Success", type: "boolean", control_type: "checkbox" },
          { name: "Id" },
          {
            name: "Errors",
            type: "array",
            of: "object",
            properties: [{ name: "Code" }, { name: "Message" }]
          }
        ]
      end


```

To know more about the output fields key, take a look at our [SDK reference](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/actions.html#output-fields>)

Object definitions

Note that `object_definitions` is passed in as an argument. Workato allows connector builders to supply the definitions of an object separately in the "object_definitions" key. This key is used when the definitions of an object are large and/or can be dynamically obtained.

To know more about this, take a look at our [SDK reference](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/object_definitions.html>)

## [#](<#step-5-defining-sample-output>) Step 5 - Defining sample output

A supplementary component to a connector, the sample output key nonetheless greatly improves a user's experience by telling users the general data type and format of output fields to expect. This allows users to build recipes more quickly.
```ruby
 
      sample_output: lambda do |connection, input|
        {
          "success" => "true",
          "Id" => "107bb8280175668b1f47e51710214497"
        }
      end


```
