# [#](<#how-to-guide-api-key-authentication>) How-to Guide - API Key Authentication

API key authentication is an authentication method that traditionally asks users to generate API keys in the application that they want to connect to. This API key may be scoped to the permissions of the user generating them or permissions could be configured on a key by key basis.

There are a variety of ways in which an API may expect to receive an API key. Common examples include:

  * Adding them in the URL parameters of each request (`GET www.api.com/resource?api-key=XXX`)
  * Adding them in the headers of each request (`X-API-KEY: XXX`)
  * Adding them to the username or password field of each request (`-u XXX` or `-u :XXX`)

## [#](<#sample-connector-iterable>) Sample Connector - Iterable
```ruby
 
    {
      title: 'Iterable',

      connection: {
        fields: [
          {
            name: 'api_key',
            label: 'API key',
            control_type: 'password',
            optional: false,
            hint: 'Get your <b>standard</b> API key <a href="https://app.' \
            'iterable.com/settings/apiKeys" target="_blank">here</a>.'
          }
        ],

        authorization: {
          type: 'api_key',

          apply: lambda do |connection|
            headers(api_key: connection['api_key'])
          end
        },

        base_uri: lambda do |connection|
          'https://api.iterable.com'
        end
      },

      test: lambda do |connection|
        get('/api/channels')
      end,

## [#](<#step-1-defining-connection-fields>) Step 1 - Defining Connection fields

This component tells Workato what fields to show to a user trying to establish a connection. In the case of API key authentication, you would need the `API key` that the user has generated in Iterable.

Information from User | Description  
---|---  
api key | The api key generated by the end user for Workato.  

This is done in the `fields` key, which accepts an array of hashes. Each hash in this array corresponds to a separate input field.
```ruby
 
        fields: [
          {
            name: 'api_key',
            label: 'API key',
            control_type: 'password',
            optional: false,
            hint: 'Get your <b>standard</b> API key <a href="https://app.' \
            'iterable.com/settings/apiKeys" target="_blank">here</a>.'
          }
        ],


```

TIP

When defining fields, you need to at least provide the `name` key. Additional attributes like `optional`, `hint` and `control_type` allow you to customize other aspects of these fields. For sensitive information like Client Secrets, remember to use the `control_type` as `password`.

## [#](<#step-2-defining-authorization>) Step 2 - Defining authorization

This component tells Workato what to do with the values received from the input fields to establish a connection. This is handled through your `authorization` key. In this key, you begin by first defining the `type` of authorization. For API Key authentication, you should use `api_key`.
```ruby
 
        authorization: {
          type: 'api_key',

          apply: lambda do |connection|
            headers(api_key: connection['api_key'])
          end
        },


```

## [#](<#step-3-applying-the-credentials-to-subsequent-http-requests>) Step 3 - Applying the credentials to subsequent HTTP requests

Next, you need to tell Workato how to make use of the API key you expect to receive from a user of this connector. This is done in the `apply` key where you can reference the API Key collected through the `connection` argument. Any instructions you introduce in the `apply` key are subsequently applied to all HTTP requests this connector sends after connection is established.

In this example, we have defined the API key we received (`connection['api_key']`) to be added to the headers of any request. For every HTTP request sent, the headers will contain `api_key: XXX` where `XXX` is the API key.

## [#](<#step-4-setting-the-api-s-base-uri>) Step 4 - Setting the API's base URI

This component tells Workato what the base URL of the API is. This key is optional but allows you to provide only relative paths in the rest of your connector when defining HTTP requests. Learn how to configure your `base_uri` [here](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/connection.html#base-uri>).
```ruby
 
        base_uri: lambda do |connection|
          "https://api.iterable.com"
        end


```

TIP

This lambda function also has access to the `connection` argument. This is especially useful if the base URI of the API might change based on the user's instance. The `connection` argument can be accessed in the following format:
```ruby
 
        base_uri: lambda do |connection|
          #some code here
        end


```

## [#](<#step-5-testing-the-connection>) Step 5 - Testing the connection

Now that we have defined the fields we need to collect from an end user and what to do with the inputs from those fields, we now need a way to test this connection. This is handled in the `test` key.
```ruby
 
        test: lambda do |connection|
          get('/api/channels')
        end,


```

In this key, you need to provide an endpoint that allows us to send a sample request using the new credentials we just received. If we receive a 200 OK HTTP response, we show the connection as Successful. In the example above, we are sending a `GET` request to the `/api/channels` endpoint and expecting a 200 response if the API key is valid.

## [#](<#variations>) Variations

In cases when you need to send the API keys in the URL parameters or User fields in each request, you simply need to modify your `apply` key.

### [#](<#api-key-in-url-parameters>) API key in URL parameters
```ruby
 
        authorization: {
          type: 'api_key',

          apply: lambda do |connection|
            params(api_key: connection['api_key']) # For URL parameters
          end
        },


```

### [#](<#api-key-in-username-field>) API key in Username field
```ruby
 
        authorization: {
          type: 'api_key',

          apply: lambda do |connection|
            user(connection['api_key']) # For username
            password("") # user method needs to be accompanied with an empty password declaration.
          end
        },


```
