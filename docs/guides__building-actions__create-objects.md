# [#](<#how-to-guides-creating-objects>) How-to guides - Creating objects

In this segment, we will be going through the creation of actions that help create objects in our target application. Typically, The `POST` HTTP request method is used to send requests to create objects.

ACTION TIMEOUT

SDK actions have a 180 second [timeout](</recipes/recipe-job-errors.html#timeouts>) limit.

## [#](<#sample-connector-zuora>) Sample connector - Zuora
```ruby

      title: 'My Zuora connector',

![Selecting the create account action](/assets/img/create_overall.24fea783.png) _Selecting the create account action_

## [#](<#step-1-action-title-subtitle-description-and-help>) Step 1 - Action title, subtitle, description, and help

The first step to making a good action is to properly communicate what the actions does, how it does it and to provide additional help to users. To do so, Workato allows you to define the title, description, and provide hints for an action. Quite simply, the title is the title of an action and the subtitle provides further details of the action. The description of the action then contains specifications and explanation on what the action accomplishes and in the context of the application it connects to. Finally, the help segment provides users any additional information required to make the action work.

To know more about this step, take a look at our [SDK reference](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/actions.html#title>)

## [#](<#step-2-define-input-fields>) Step 2 - Define input fields
```ruby
input_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|
```
        [
          {
            name: "AccountNumber",
            label: "Account Number",
            hint: "Unique account number assigned to the account. " \
            "Leave null to auto-generate."
          },
          {
            name: "AccountName",
            label: "Account name",
            hint: "The name of newly created account."
          },
          {
            name: "Currency",
            label: "Currency",
            hint: "Currency that the customer is billed in.",
            optional: false
          }
        ]
      end



![Create account input fields](/assets/img/create_account_input.8fc5076b.png) _Create account input fields_

This component tells Workato what fields to show to a user trying to create an object. In the case of creating an account in Zuora for example, the user has to input the `AccountNumber`, `AccountName` and `Currency` of the new account to be created. Do take note that for the `Currency` input field, the "optional" key is assigned the value "false", this means that users must provide a value of the currency that the customer is billed in, if not, the user cannot proceed in the building of the recipe.

Various other key value pairs exist for input/output fields other than the ones defined above. Click [here](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/actions.html#input-fields>) to find out more.

Object definitions

Note that `object_definitions` is passed in as an argument. Workato allows connector builders to supply the definitions of an object separately in the "object_definitions" key. This key is used when the definitions of an object are large and/or can be dynamically obtained.

To know more about this, take a look at our [SDK reference](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/object_definitions.html>)

## [#](<#step-3-defining-the-execute-key>) Step 3 - Defining the execute key

The execute key tells Workato the endpoint to send the request to and using which HTTP request method. In this example, we send our request to `https://rest.zuora.com/v1/object/account` using the `POST` method. We also append the `after_error_response` method to the request to catch any errors and to display them to users to aid in the debugging during recipe building.
```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
        post("https://rest.zuora.com/v1/object/account", input).
          after_error_response(/.*/) do |_, body, _, message|
            error("#{message}: #{body}")
          end
      end


```

To know more about the execute key, take a look at our [SDK reference](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/actions.html#execute>)

## [#](<#step-4-defining-output-fields>) Step 4 - Defining output fields

This section tells us what datapills to show as the output of the trigger. The `name` attributes of each datapill should match the keys in the output of the `execute` key.
```ruby
output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|
```
        [
          { name: "Success", type: "boolean", control_type: "checkbox" },
          { name: "Id" },
          {
            name: "Errors",
            type: "array",
            of: "object",
            properties: [{ name: "Code" }, { name: "Message" }]
          }
        ]
      end

Object definitions

Note that `object_definitions` is passed in as an argument. Workato allows connector builders to supply the definitions of an object separately in the "object_definitions" key. This key is used when the definitions of an object are large and/or can be dynamically obtained.

To know more about this, take a look at our [SDK reference](</developing-connectors/sdk/sdk-reference/object_definitions.html>)

## [#](<#step-5-defining-sample-output>) Step 5 - Defining sample output

A supplementary component to a connector, the sample output key nonetheless greatly improves a user's experience by telling users the general data type and format of output fields to expect. This allows users to build recipes more quickly.
```ruby
sample_output: lambda do |connection, input|
        {
          "success" => "true",
          "Id" => "107bb8280175668b1f47e51710214497"
        }
      end


```
